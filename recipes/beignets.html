        <li>Combine sugar, salt, spice, egg, pumpkin, butter and cream into a large bowl and mix. then pour in yeast
            water and mix again </li>
        <li>Add flour, and knead using the dough hook on a stand mixer or knead with your hands until the dough is
            smooth and combined, it should still be quite sticky.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave in a warm place to double in size,
            about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>roll out dough till 1cm thick and use a cut out to make the mickey shapess or you can simply cut 
            into squares</li>
        <li>Pour frying oil into a deep sided heavy pot until it is about as deep as your index finger. Heat the 
            oil on medium, making sure to use a thermometer. The oil needs to reach close to 175c/350f.</li>
        <li>Fry the dough in batches for about 1 minute on each side, or until a golden brown colour is reached. 
            Remove carefully using a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>to serve, sift icing sugar and pumpkin pie spices together and dust generously on top of beignets. Enjoy
