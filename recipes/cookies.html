    <ol>
        <h4 class="smalltitle">macron shells</h4>
        <li>sift almond meal and powdered sugar into a bowl and combine, add 50g of the egg
            whites and mix until it becomes a paste. cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>weigh out 45g of egg whites for your meringue and place in a stand mixer bowl/ mixing
            bowl.</li>
        <li>in a saucepan, combine water and caster sugar. boil over medium-high heat and check
            with a candy thermometer.</li>
        <li>once the syrup reaches 110c/230f, start whipping your egg whites at medium speed until
            the egg whites are frothy and almost at soft peaks.</li>
        <li>when the syrup has reached 120c /248f, slowly pour the syrup down the side of your
            mixer bowl in a thin stream while the mixer is running on medium speed.</li>
        <li>once all the syrup has been incorporated, increase the speed to high and whip for
            another 2 minutes until the meringue is glossy and firm. At this point add the food
            colouring to make the meringue green (yellow, blue, and a tiny bit of black) and whip until
            incorporated and the desired colour of green is reached</li>
        <li>fold 1/3 of the meringue into the batter to lighten it. once incorporated, add the rest of
            the meringue and fold gently until just combined. when the batter dropped from a spatula flows 
            in a consistent stream and a figure 8 can be drawn, stop mixing. Transfer to a piping bag fitted 
            with a small round piping tip</li>
        <li>pipe the green batter onto a baking sheet lined with baking paper using a template to
            create the frog face shapes (the template should be under the baking paper)
        <li>tap the tray on a hard surface to remove air bubbles and using a toothpick, smooth out
            the surface where air bubbles have popped.</li>
        <li>leave the piped batter to dry for 30 mins-1 hr (in front of a fan if it’s humid) or until a dry
            skin forms on top and the batter doesn’t stick to your fingers. Preheat the oven to
            150c/320f</li>
        <li>bake at 150c/320f for 12 mins or until the inside is no longer sticky.
            15. Cool the shells for 10-15 mins and they should peel off easily. If they don’t, you can
            always bake them longer, but be careful not to let them brown!</li>
        <li>once cool, pair the macarons by size. </li>
    </ol>

        <h4 class="smalltitle"> matcha buttrcream</h4>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>While the syrup is heating up, beat the egg yolks until pale</li>
        <li>When the syrup reaches 120c, pour slowly into the egg yolks while beating on medium
        speed. Once all the syrup is combined, keep beating for another minute until creamy</li>
        <li>Add the butter little by little while beating on high speed. Once all the butter is
        incorporated, keep beating until the buttercream reaches a smooth and fluffy
        consistency.</li>
        <li>Fold in sifted matcha powder.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <h4 class="smalltitle"> icing</h4>
        <li>Combine powdered sugar with milk little by little until it reaches a thick but flowing
            consistency, once done colour it with black. </li>
        <li>Using a paper piping bag (you can fold one out of baking paper) pipe the features onto
        the froggys. Let dry for 10 mins and brush on ‘blush’ using powdered red food colouring.</li>
    </ol>
